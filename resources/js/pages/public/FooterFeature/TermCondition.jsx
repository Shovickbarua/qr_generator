<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Services or these Terms, please contact us at [your email address] and we will try to resolve them amicably. However, if a dispute arises between us that we cannot resolve informally, then you agree that it will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, unless you opt out of arbitration as described below. You also agree to waive your right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services (each, a Dispute) will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (AAA Rules), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms or the AAA Rules are void or voidable. The arbitrator will also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this Arbitration Agreement or the arbitrability of any Dispute. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties.</p>

<p>You and we agree that the arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, or representative basis. Neither you nor we shall be a member in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable for any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void and severed from these Terms, and the parties agree that any Dispute shall be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in [your jurisdiction].</p>

<p>You and we agree that any arbitration will be conducted in [your jurisdiction] or at another mutually agreed location. You and we agree that each party will bear its own costs and fees in connection with any arbitration, except that the AAA fees will be split equally between the parties.</p>

<p>You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of the date you first agreed to these Terms by writing to us at [your email address] and clearly stating your intent to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.</p>

<p>These Terms and our Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [your jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement above, you and we agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be brought exclusively in a state or federal court located in [your jurisdiction]. You and we consent to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in such courts.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of our Services and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.
